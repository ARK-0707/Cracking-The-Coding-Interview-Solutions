# Heavy Pill Problem

## Problem Description

You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles contain pills that each weigh 1.0 gram, but one bottle contains pills that each weigh 1.1 grams. You have a scale that provides an exact measurement. How can you determine which bottle contains the heavier pills using the scale only once?

### Approach

1. **Label the Bottles**: Label each bottle from 1 to 20.
2. **Take Pills from Each Bottle**: Take a different number of pills from each bottle. For example, take 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle 2, 3 pills from bottle 3, and so on up to 20 pills from bottle 20.
3. **Weigh the Pills**: Weigh all the pills together on the scale.
4. **Calculate the Expected Weight**: If all pills were 1.0 gram, the total weight would be the sum of the first 20 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 20).
5. **Determine the Heavy Bottle**: The difference between the measured weight and the expected weight will indicate which bottle is heavier. The difference divided by 0.1 will give the number of the heavy bottle.

### Example Usage

```python
import random

def heavyPill():
    bottles = [1.0] * 20
    heavy_bottle_index = random.randint(0, 19)
    print(f"Heavy bottle index (for reference): {heavy_bottle_index}")

    bottles[heavy_bottle_index] = 1.1
    measured_weight = 0

    for i in range(len(bottles)):
        measured_weight += (i + 1) * bottles[i]

    expected_weight = sum(range(1, 21))

    difference = measured_weight - expected_weight
    heavy_bottle = round((difference * 10) - 1)
    return heavy_bottle

heavy_bottle = heavyPill()
print(f"The heavy bottle is bottle number: {heavy_bottle}")
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Label each bottle from 1 to 20.
- **Step 2**: Take a different number of pills from each bottle. For example, take 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle 2, and so on.
- **Step 3**: Weigh all the pills together on the scale.
- **Step 4**: Calculate the expected weight if all pills were 1.0 gram. This is the sum of the first 20 natural numbers, which is 210 grams.
- **Step 5**: The difference between the measured weight and the expected weight will indicate which bottle is heavier. Since the extra weight comes from the heavier pills, the difference divided by 0.1 will give the number of the heavy bottle.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the operations are constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a few variables are used.

This method allows you to determine the heavy bottle using the scale only once, leveraging the difference in weight to pinpoint the exact bottle.
