# 16.1 Number Swapper

## Description

Write a function to swap a number **in place** (that is, without temporary variables).

### Follow Up

How would you do this using arithmetic operations instead of Python's built-in value unpacking?

**Example**

Before swapping:

```
num1 = 10, num2 = 20
```

After swapping:

```
num1 = 20, num2 = 10
```

## Explanation

The code demonstrates two approaches to swapping numbers in Python:

* **`swapPy(num1, num2)`**: Uses Python's tuple unpacking to swap values in one line.
* **`swap(num1, num2)`**: Uses arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`) to swap values without a temporary variable.

Both methods return the swapped values as a list.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* Both methods have a time complexity of **ùëÇ(1)** as they perform a constant number of operations.

#### Space Complexity

* **`swapPy`** uses Python's tuple unpacking, which internally may allocate temporary memory, but conceptually is considered **ùëÇ(1)**.
* **`swap`** uses arithmetic and does **not** allocate extra memory, so it is **ùëÇ(1)** in space.

### Python Code

```python
# Function using Python value assignment
def swapPy(num1, num2):
    num1, num2 = num2, num1
    return [num1, num2]

# Function using arithmetic operations
def swap(num1, num2):
    num1 = num1 + num2
    num2 = num1 - num2
    num1 = num1 - num2
    return [num1, num2]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 20
    print(f"num1 and num2 before swapping is: {num1}, {num2}")
    print("----------------------------------------")
    print("Using Python value assignment")
    result = swapPy(num1, num2)
    print(f"num1 and num2 after swapping is: {result[0]}, {result[1]}")
    print("----------------------------------------")
    print("Using arithmetic operators")
    result1 = swap(num1, num2)
    print(f"num1 and num2 after swapping is: {result1[0]}, {result1[1]}")
```

By using either method, we can efficiently swap two numbers without introducing a temporary variable, making it ideal for memory-constrained environments or for practicing low-level algorithmic thinking.
