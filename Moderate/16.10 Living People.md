# 16.10 Living People

## Description

Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to compute the year with **most number of
people alive**. You may assume that all people were born between **1900** and **2000** (inclusive). If a person was alive during
a portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count. `For example, Person (birth = 1908, death = 1909)
is included in the counts for both 1908 and 1909.`

## Example

**Input:**

```python
people = [
    (1944, 1989),
    (1963, 1966),
    (1941, 1941),
    (1937, 1974),
    (1912, 1978),
    (1995, 1995),
    (1965, 1965),
    (1994, 1994),
    (1909, 1933),
    (1920, 1992)
]
```

**Output:**

```
The year with most number of people alive is: 1965 & population is: 7
```

## Explanation

The `maxPopulatedYear` function uses a **prefix sum technique** to efficiently calculate population for each year from 1900 to 2000:

1. **Create a delta array** (size 102: 101 years + 1):

   * Increment at birth year
   * Decrement the year **after death**
2. Use a **cumulative sum** to get the total population for each year.
3. Track the year with the **maximum** population seen so far.

### Why It’s Efficient

Instead of iterating through every year for every person (𝑂(n×100)), we compress all operations into just **two linear passes**:

* One for applying deltas
* One for computing population

---

## Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **𝑂(n + y)** where `n` = number of people, `y` = number of years (fixed to 101)

#### Space Complexity

* **𝑂(y)** for the `years` list (101 elements from 1900 to 2000 inclusive)

---

## Python Code

```python
def maxPopulatedYear(people):
    START_YEAR = 1900
    END_YEAR = 2000
    years = [0] * (END_YEAR - START_YEAR + 2)  # Extra year for handling deaths

    # Mark births and deaths
    for birth, death in people:
        years[birth - START_YEAR] += 1
        years[death - START_YEAR + 1] -= 1

    max_population = 0
    max_year = START_YEAR
    current_population = 0

    # Calculate running population and track max
    for year in range(END_YEAR - START_YEAR + 1):
        current_population += years[year]
        if current_population > max_population:
            max_population = current_population
            max_year = START_YEAR + year

    return max_year, max_population

# Example Usage
people = [
    (1944, 1989),
    (1963, 1966),
    (1941, 1941),
    (1937, 1974),
    (1912, 1978),
    (1995, 1995),
    (1965, 1965),
    (1994, 1994),
    (1909, 1933),
    (1920, 1992)
]

max_year, max_population = maxPopulatedYear(people)
print(f"The year with most number of people alive is: {max_year} & population is: {max_population}")
```

This algorithm efficiently finds the peak population year using cumulative logic, making it suitable for large-scale demographic analysis.
