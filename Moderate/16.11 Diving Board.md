# 16.11 Diving Board

## Description

You are building a **diving board** by placing a bunch of planks of wood end-to-end. There are two types of planks, **one length shorter and one of length longer**. You must use exactly **K** planks of wood. Write a method to generate all possible lengths for the diving board.

## Example

**Input:**

```python
divingBoard(1, 2, 3)
```

**Output:**

```python
[3, 4, 5, 6]
```

**Explanation:**
The combinations of plank usages and their total lengths:

* 3 short: `1+1+1 = 3`
* 2 short + 1 long: `1+1+2 = 4`
* 1 short + 2 long: `1+2+2 = 5`
* 3 long: `2+2+2 = 6`

---

## Edge Cases

```python
divingBoard(2, 2, 3) ‚Üí [6]  # All planks are same length ‚Üí only one possibility  
divingBoard(1, 3, 0) ‚Üí []   # No planks ‚Üí no board
```

---

## Explanation

The function generates all unique combinations of `shorter` and `longer` plank usages summing up to exactly `K` planks.

* If `shorter == longer`: All boards are of the same length ‚Üí return `[K * shorter]`
* If `K == 0`: No planks ‚Üí return `[]`
* Else: Loop from 0 to `K` planks of `longer`, and calculate total length for each configuration

### Optimization

We use a **`set`** to avoid duplicates and then return a **sorted list** of results.

---

## Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **ùëÇ(K)**: Iterates through all possible numbers of `longer` planks from `0` to `K`.

#### Space Complexity

* **ùëÇ(K)**: For storing up to `K+1` unique lengths in the result list.

---

## Python Code

```python
def divingBoard(shorter, longer, K):
    if K == 0:
        return []
    if shorter == longer:
        return [K * shorter]

    lengths = set()
    for i in range(K + 1):
        length = i * longer + (K - i) * shorter
        lengths.add(length)

    return sorted(lengths)

# Example Usage
print(divingBoard(1, 2, 3))  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]
print(divingBoard(2, 2, 3))  # Output: [6]
print(divingBoard(1, 3, 0))  # Output: []
```

---

This function gives all the **unique total lengths** you can make using exactly `K` planks of two different sizes‚Äîuseful in combinatorics, hardware simulation, and optimization scenarios.
