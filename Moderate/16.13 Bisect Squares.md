# 16.13 Bisect Squares

## Description

Given two squares on a **two-dimensional plane**, find a line that would cut these two squares in **half**. Assume that the top and bottom sides of the square run **parallel to the x-axis**.

---

## Example

**Input:**

```python
sq1 = Square(0, 0, 2)
sq2 = Square(4, 4, 2)
```

**Output:**

```
Line that cuts both squares in half: [(-0.0, -0.0), (6.0, 6.0)]
```

---

## Explanation

1. A `Square` is represented by:

   * Its **bottom-left corner** (`x`, `y`)
   * Its **side length**

2. The **center** of each square is calculated using:

   ```
   center_x = x + length / 2
   center_y = y + length / 2
   ```

3. The **line that cuts both squares in half** must go through both centers.
   This is either:

   * A **vertical line** if the centers have the same `x`
   * Or a **diagonal/tilted line** connecting both centers

4. The line is extended to span both squares using:

   * The minimum and maximum `x` values of both squares
   * Then computing the corresponding `y` using the line equation:

     ```
     y = y1 + slope * (x - x1)
     ```

## Python Code

```python
class Square:
    def __init__(self, x, y, length):
        self.x = x  # Bottom-left corner x
        self.y = y  # Bottom-left corner y
        self.length = length

    def center(self):
        return self.x + self.length / 2, self.y + self.length / 2


def cut_squares(square1, square2):
    (x1, y1) = square1.center()
    (x2, y2) = square2.center()

    # Special case: vertical line
    if x1 == x2:
        return [(x1, min(square1.y, square2.y)), (x1, max(square1.y + square1.length, square2.y + square2.length))]

    # General case: calculate slope and use line equation
    slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    min_x = float(min(square1.x, square2.x))
    max_x = float(max(square1.x + square1.length, square2.x + square2.length))

    point1 = (min_x, y1 + slope * (min_x - x1))
    point2 = (max_x, y1 + slope * (max_x - x1))

    return [point1, point2]


# Example Usage
sq1 = Square(0, 0, 2)
sq2 = Square(4, 4, 2)

line = cut_squares(sq1, sq2)
print("Line that cuts both squares in half:", line)
```

This geometric solution elegantly identifies the line that divides two squares through their centers and is useful in layout design, game engines, or geometric algorithms.
