# 16.14 Best Line

## Description

Given a **two-dimensional** graph with points, find a line which passes the **most number of points**.

---

## Example

**Input:**

```python
points = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4)]
```

**Output:**

```
Maximum 3 points lie on the line: ((1, 1), Fraction(1, 1))
```

---

## Explanation

The function checks every point `i` against all other points `j` (where `j > i`) and computes:

* The **slope** of the line between the points
* Special handling for:

  * **Vertical lines** (slope = `'inf'`)
  * **Duplicate points** (identical coordinates)

It then:

* Tracks the **count** of each slope using a `defaultdict`
* Keeps the **max count** for each anchor point
* Records the **line (point, slope)** with the most points

### Slope Representation

To avoid floating-point errors:

* Slopes are calculated using Python’s `Fraction` from the `fractions` module for exact rational numbers.

---

## Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **𝑂(n²)**: For every point, we compare it to all others.

#### Space Complexity

* **𝑂(n)**: For the hash map tracking slopes.

## Python Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from fractions import Fraction

def max_points_on_line(points):
    if not points:
        return 0

    max_result = 0
    best_line = None

    for i in range(len(points)):
        slope_count = defaultdict(int)
        duplicates = 0
        curr_max = 0
        point_i = points[i]

        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            point_j = points[j]
            x1, y1 = point_i
            x2, y2 = point_j

            if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
                duplicates += 1
                continue
            elif x1 == x2:
                slope = 'inf'  # vertical line
            else:
                slope = Fraction(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)

            slope_count[slope] += 1
            if slope_count[slope] > curr_max:
                curr_max = slope_count[slope]
                best_current_slope = slope

        total = curr_max + duplicates + 1  # include point_i itself
        if total > max_result:
            max_result = total
            if 'best_current_slope' in locals():
                best_line = (point_i, best_current_slope)
            else:
                best_line = (point_i, 'inf')

    return max_result, best_line

# Example Usage
points = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4)]
count, line = max_points_on_line(points)
print(f"Maximum {count} points lie on the line:", line)
```

---

## Output

```
Maximum 3 points lie on the line: ((1, 1), Fraction(1, 1))
```

This means the line starting at `(1, 1)` with a slope of `1` (i.e., y = x) passes through 3 points.

This function is useful in **computational geometry**, **data clustering**, and **graph analysis** to detect collinear trends among a set of points.
