# 16.15 Master Mind

## Description

The Game of **Master Mind** is played as follows:

The computer has **four slots**, and each slot will contain a ball that is **red (R)**, **yellow (Y)**, **green (G)**, or **blue (B)**. For example, the computer might have **RGGB** (Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).
You, the user, are trying to guess the solution. You might, for example, guess **YRGB**.

When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a **"hit"**. If you guess a color that exists but is in the wrong slot, you get a **"pseudo-hit."** Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as pseudo-hit.
For example, if the actual solution is **RGBY** and you guess **GGRR**, you have one hit and one pseudo-hit.

Write a method that, given a guess and a solution, **returns the number of hits and pseudo-hits.**

---

## Example

**Solution:** `"RGBY"`
**Guess:** `"GGRR"`

**Output:**

```
Hits: 1, Pseudo-hits: 1
```

Explanation:

* Hit at index 2: `B` in both guess and solution
* Pseudo-hit: `G` exists in solution but in the wrong position

---

## Explanation

1. First pass:

   * Compare each slot in `solution` and `guess`
   * Count **exact matches (hits)** and store non-matching characters for further checking

2. Second pass:

   * Use a `Counter` to track remaining colors in the `solution`
   * For each unmatched character in `guess`, count a **pseudo-hit** only if it's still available in the solution (and not already a hit)

---

## Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **O(n)** where n = 4 (constant) → effectively O(1)

#### Space Complexity

* **O(1)** → limited by fixed-size arrays and counter

## Python Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def master_mind(solution, guess):
    if len(solution) != 4 or len(guess) != 4:
        raise ValueError("Both solution and guess must be of length 4.")

    hits = 0
    pseudo_hits = 0

    unmatched_solution = []
    unmatched_guess = []

    # First pass to count hits
    for s, g in zip(solution, guess):
        if s == g:
            hits += 1
        else:
            unmatched_solution.append(s)
            unmatched_guess.append(g)

    # Count remaining unmatched solution colors
    freq = Counter(unmatched_solution)

    # Second pass for pseudo-hits
    for g in unmatched_guess:
        if freq[g] > 0:
            pseudo_hits += 1
            freq[g] -= 1

    return hits, pseudo_hits

# Example Usage
solution = "RGBY"
guess = "GGRR"
hits, pseudo_hits = master_mind(solution, guess)
print(f"Hits: {hits}, Pseudo-hits: {pseudo_hits}")
```

---

## Output

```
Hits: 1, Pseudo-hits: 1
```

This function is useful for coding puzzle games, pattern recognition problems, and logical deduction games.
