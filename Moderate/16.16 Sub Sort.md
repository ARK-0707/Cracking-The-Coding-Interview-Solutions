# 16.16 Sub Sort

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices **m** and **n** such that if you sorted elements **m** through **n**, the
entire array would be sorted. Minimize **n - m** (that is, find the smallest such sequence).

---

## Example

**Input:**

```
[1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19]
```

**Output:**

```
(3, 9)
```

Explanation:

* Sorting from index 3 (`7`) to 9 (`7`) gives the sorted array:

  ```
  [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 19]
  ```

---

## Approach

1. **Scan from left** to find the first element that breaks the sorted order — mark this as initial `m`.
2. **Scan from right** to find the first element that breaks the sorted order — mark this as initial `n`.
3. Find the **min and max** values between indices `m` and `n`.
4. Expand the window if needed:

   * Expand `m` leftward if any earlier element is greater than `min`.
   * Expand `n` rightward if any later element is smaller than `max`.

---

## Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Python Code

```python
def find_unsorted_window(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n <= 1:
        return (0, 0)

    # Step 1: Find the first out-of-order from the left
    m = 0
    while m < n - 1 and arr[m] <= arr[m + 1]:
        m += 1
    if m == n - 1:
        return (0, 0)  # Already sorted

    # Step 2: Find the first out-of-order from the right
    end = n - 1
    while end > 0 and arr[end] >= arr[end - 1]:
        end -= 1

    # Step 3: Find min and max within the window
    window_min = min(arr[m:end + 1])
    window_max = max(arr[m:end + 1])

    # Step 4: Expand left bound if needed
    while m > 0 and arr[m - 1] > window_min:
        m -= 1

    # Step 5: Expand right bound if needed
    while end < n - 1 and arr[end + 1] < window_max:
        end += 1

    return (m, end)

# Example Usage
arr = [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19]
print(find_unsorted_window(arr))  # Output: (3, 9)
```

---

## Output

```
(3, 9)
```

This function is useful for:

* Optimizing sorting in nearly-sorted datasets
* Validating data integrity
* Detecting disorder in large numeric sequences
