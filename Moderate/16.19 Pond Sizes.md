# 16.19 Pond Sizes

## Description

You have an integer matrix representing a plot of **land**, where the value at that location represents the height above
sea level. A value **zero** indicates **water**. A pond is a region of water connected **vertically**, **horiizontally**, or **diagonally**.
The size of the pond is the `total number of connected water cells`. Write a method to compute the sizes of all ponds in
the matrix.


**Example**

Input Matrix:

```
0 2 1 0  
0 1 0 1  
1 1 0 1  
0 1 0 1
```

Output:

```
[2, 4, 1] (Order may vary)
```

## Explanation

The function `pond_sizes(matrix)` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal to explore all water-connected cells (value = 0) in 8 directions — including diagonals — and calculates the size of each pond. Visited cells are marked to avoid recounting.

### Approach

1. Traverse every cell in the matrix.
2. When a `0` (water cell) is found, perform a DFS from that cell.
3. Count all connected water cells, marking them visited.
4. Store the result and continue the search.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

* Worst-case **O(m × n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is visited at most once.

#### Space Complexity:

* **O(m × n)** for the recursive DFS call stack in the worst case (if the entire matrix is water).

## Python Code

```python
def pond_sizes(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return []

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    sizes = []

    def dfs(r, c):
        # Base case:
        if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or matrix[r][c] != 0:
            return 0

        # Mark this cell as visited (e.g., -1)
        matrix[r][c] = -1
        size = 1

        # Explore all 8 directions
        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
                if dr != 0 or dc != 0:
                    size += dfs(r + dr, c + dc)
        return size

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if matrix[r][c] == 0:
                pond_size = dfs(r, c)
                sizes.append(pond_size)

    return sizes


# Example Usage
land = [
    [0, 2, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1]
]

print(pond_sizes(land))  # Output: [2, 4, 1] (order may vary)
```
