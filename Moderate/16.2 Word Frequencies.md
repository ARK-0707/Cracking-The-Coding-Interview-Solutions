# 16.2 Word Frequencies

## Description

Design a method to find the `frequency of occurrences` of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

### Follow Up

How would you optimize the solution if you were running this algorithm multiple times?

**Example**

For the given book text:

```
"This is a sample book. This book is only for testing."
```

**Query Results**

```
"book"          → 2  
"this"          → 2  
"is"            → 2  
"not_in_book"   → 0  
```

## Explanation

The `BookAnalyzer` class helps efficiently analyze word frequencies in a book:

* In the constructor, the text is **preprocessed once**:

  * Converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
  * Punctuation is removed and text is split into words.
  * A `Counter` dictionary is built to store word frequencies.

* The `get_frequency(word)` method returns the frequency of a word in **𝑂(1)** time.

This structure is particularly efficient for **multiple frequency queries**, as preprocessing happens only once.

### Complexity

#### Preprocessing

* **Time Complexity**: 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of characters in the text (for normalization and splitting).
* **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(𝑚), where 𝑚 is the number of unique words.

#### Querying (`get_frequency`)

* **Time Complexity**: 𝑂(1) for each query.
* **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(1) per query (uses pre-built dictionary).

### Python Code

```python
from collections import Counter

class BookAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, book_text):
        self.word_count = self._preprocess(book_text)

    def _preprocess(self, text):
        # Normalize text
        text = text.lower()
        # Replace punctuation with spaces and split into words
        words = ''.join(char if char.isalnum() else ' ' for char in text).split()
        # Count word frequencies
        return Counter(words)

    def get_frequency(self, word):
        # Normalize query word and return frequency
        word = word.lower()
        return self.word_count.get(word, 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    book_text = """This is a sample book. This book is only for testing."""
    analyzer = BookAnalyzer(book_text)

    # Single query
    print(analyzer.get_frequency("book"))  # Output: 2

    # Multiple queries
    print(analyzer.get_frequency("this"))        # Output: 2
    print(analyzer.get_frequency("is"))          # Output: 2
    print(analyzer.get_frequency("not_in_book")) # Output: 0
```

By using this structure, we ensure high performance for repeated frequency checks in large books. This is especially useful for applications like word indexing, concordance generation, or natural language analysis.
