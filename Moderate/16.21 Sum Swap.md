# 16.21 Sum Swap

## Description

Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one value from each array) that you can swap to give two arrays the same sum.

## Problem Statement

You are given:

```python
arr1 = [4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]
arr2 = [3, 6, 3, 3]
```

You need to find a pair `[a, b]` such that:

* `a` is from `arr1`, `b` is from `arr2`
* Swapping `a` and `b` results in `sum(arr1) == sum(arr2)`

**Example Output**:

```
[1, 3]
```

## Logic & Explanation

Let:

* `sum1 = sum(arr1)`
* `sum2 = sum(arr2)`

To balance the sums after swapping `a` and `b`:

```
sum1 - a + b == sum2 - b + a
```

Solving this gives:

```
b = a + (sum2 - sum1) / 2
```

This only works if `(sum2 - sum1)` is even (i.e., divisible by 2).

We use a set for the second array for fast lookup (`O(1)` time per query).

### Algorithm Steps

1. Calculate total sums of both arrays.
2. Compute `delta = (sum2 - sum1) / 2`
3. Iterate through `arr1` and for each element `a`, check if `a + delta` exists in `arr2`.
4. Return the pair `[a, a + delta]` if found.

## Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`

  * `O(n)` for iterating over `arr1`
  * `O(m)` to build the hash set from `arr2`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(m)` for storing the set of `arr2`

## Python Code

```python
def find_swap_pair(arr1, arr2):
    sum1 = sum(arr1)
    sum2 = sum(arr2)
    delta = sum2 - sum1

    if delta % 2 != 0:
        return None  # Can't find such a pair, result must be an integer

    delta //= 2  # We want b = a + delta

    set2 = set(arr2)  # For O(1) lookups

    for a in arr1:
        b = a + delta
        if b in set2:
            return [a, b]

    return None

# Example
arr1 = [4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]
arr2 = [3, 6, 3, 3]
print(find_swap_pair(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1, 3]
```
