# 16.22 Langton's Ant

## Problem Description

An ant is sittimg on an `infinite grid` of **white** and **black** squares. It initially faces **right**. At each step, it does
the following:

**(1)** At a **white** square, flip the color of the square, turn `90 degrees right`** (clockwise), and move forward one unit.

**(2)** At a **black** square, flip the color of the square, turn `90 degrees left` (counterclockwise), and move forward one unit.

Write a program to simulate the first `K` moves that the ant makes and print the final board as a grid. Note that you are
not provided with the data structure to represent the grid. This is something you must design yourself. The only input
to your method is `K`, You should print the final grid and return nothing. The method signature might be something like
`void PrintKMoves( int K )`.

## Objective

Write a method `printKMoves(K)` that:

* Simulates the ant’s first `K` moves.
* Prints the final grid with:

  * `B` for black squares
  * `W` for white squares
  * An arrow (`↑`, `→`, `↓`, `←`) for the ant’s final position and direction

---

## Grid Design

* Use a **set** to store black cells (since default color is white).
* Represent coordinates as `(row, col)` tuples.
* Track `min/max row` and `min/max col` to print only the region visited by the ant.

## Directions Mapping

```python
directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]  # [UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT]
symbols    = ['↑', '→', '↓', '←']                # For displaying ant's direction
```

---

## Python Implementation

```python
def printKMoves(K):
    black = set()           # Track black squares
    row, col = 0, 0         # Starting position
    direction = 1           # Start facing RIGHT

    # Direction vectors and symbols
    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]  # [UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT]
    symbols = ['↑', '→', '↓', '←']

    # Track printed bounds
    min_row = max_row = row
    min_col = max_col = col

    for _ in range(K):
        pos = (row, col)
        if pos in black:
            black.remove(pos)                  # Flip black to white
            direction = (direction - 1) % 4    # Turn left
        else:
            black.add(pos)                     # Flip white to black
            direction = (direction + 1) % 4    # Turn right

        # Move forward
        dr, dc = directions[direction]
        row += dr
        col += dc

        # Update boundaries
        min_row = min(min_row, row)
        max_row = max(max_row, row)
        min_col = min(min_col, col)
        max_col = max(max_col, col)

    ant_pos = (row, col)
    ant_dir = direction

    # Print final grid
    for r in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
        row_str = ""
        for c in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
            if (r, c) == ant_pos:
                row_str += symbols[ant_dir]
            elif (r, c) in black:
                row_str += 'B'
            else:
                row_str += 'W'
        print(row_str)
```

## Example Run

```python
printKMoves(5)
```

**Output Example (may vary by direction/order):**

```
WB
W→
```

## Time and Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(K)
* **Space Complexity:** O(V), where V is the number of visited cells (≤ K)
