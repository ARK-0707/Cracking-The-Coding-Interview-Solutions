# 16.23 Rand7 from Rand5

### ðŸŽ² **Problem Description**  
Implement a method `rand7()` given `rand5()`. That is, given a method that generates a random number between `0 and 4` (inclusive), write a method that generates a random number between `0 and 6` (inclusive).

---

### âœ… **Approach**
- `rand5()` returns values from 0â€“4, so:
  - `rand5() * 5 + rand5()` gives numbers from 0â€“24 (i.e., 5Ã—5 possibilities).
- We only accept values from **0â€“20** to keep uniformity (21â€“24 are discarded).
- Then take `num % 7` to map it to a 0â€“6 range.

---

### ðŸ’» **Python Code**

```python
import random
from collections import defaultdict

# Simulate rand5() which returns a random number between 0 and 4
def rand5():
    return random.randint(0, 4)

# Generate rand7() using only rand5()
def rand7():
    while True:
        num = 5 * rand5() + rand5()  # Range 0 to 24 (uniform distribution)
        if num < 21:                 # Only accept 0 to 20 for fair mapping
            return num % 7           # Returns 0 to 6

# Test rand7 distribution
def test_rand7(trials=100000):
    counts = defaultdict(int)

    for _ in range(trials):
        val = rand7()
        counts[val] += 1

    print(f"Results after {trials} trials of rand7():\n")
    for i in range(7):
        percentage = (counts[i] / trials) * 100
        print(f"Number {i} occurred {counts[i]} times ({percentage:.2f}%)")

# Run the test
test_rand7()
```

### ðŸ“Œ Sample Output (may vary):
```
Results after 100000 trials of rand7():

Number 0 occurred 14255 times (14.26%)
Number 1 occurred 14279 times (14.28%)
Number 2 occurred 14157 times (14.16%)
Number 3 occurred 14402 times (14.40%)
Number 4 occurred 14321 times (14.32%)
Number 5 occurred 14305 times (14.30%)
Number 6 occurred 14281 times (14.28%)
```
