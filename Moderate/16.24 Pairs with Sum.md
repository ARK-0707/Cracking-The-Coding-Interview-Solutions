# 16.24 Pairs with Sum

## Description

Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array that sum to a specific value.

**Example**

Given the array:
`[1, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 0, -1, 7]`
Target sum: `6`

**Output Pairs**
`(1, 5), (2, 4), (-1, 7), (0, 6), (3, 3)` (no duplicates, order may vary)

## Explanation

The `find_pairs_with_sum` function iterates over each element in the input array, storing each element in a `set` as it proceeds. For each element, it computes the `complement` such that `element + complement == target`. If the complement is found in the set of previously seen values, a sorted tuple of the pair is added to a set to avoid duplicates.

This method ensures that:

* Each valid pair is only included once
* Time complexity is kept optimal using constant-time set operations

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity:

* The function runs in **𝑂(𝑛)** time, where 𝑛 is the number of elements in the array. Each lookup and insertion in the set is 𝑂(1) on average.

#### Space Complexity:

* The space complexity is **𝑂(𝑛)** due to the additional space required for the `seen` set and `pairs` set.

## Python Code

```python
def find_pairs_with_sum(arr, target):
    seen = set()
    pairs = set()  # to avoid duplicates

    for num in arr:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            pairs.add(tuple(sorted((num, complement))))
        seen.add(num)

    return list(pairs)


# Example usage
arr = [1, 4, 6, 2, 3, 5, 0, -1, 7]
target = 6
result = find_pairs_with_sum(arr, target)
print("Pairs that sum to", target, "are:", result)
```
