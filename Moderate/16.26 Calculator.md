# 16.26 Calculator

## Description

Given an arithmetic equation consisting of positive integers, `+, -, *, /` (no parentheses), compute the result.

**Example**

```text
Input:  2*3+5/6*3+15  
Output: 23.5
```

## Explanation

The `evaluate_expression` function parses the input string character by character. It uses a stack to track intermediate values based on the current operator. The function respects operator precedence by evaluating `*` and `/` immediately, while `+` and `-` are added to the stack and summed at the end.

### How it works:

* Numbers are built digit-by-digit.
* Operators are tracked, and based on the previous operator, values are either pushed to the stack (for `+`, `-`) or used in immediate calculations (for `*`, `/`).
* Finally, the stack is summed to get the final result.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity:

* **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once, and stack operations are constant time.

### Space Complexity:

* **O(n)** in the worst case due to the stack storing all the intermediate values.

## Python Code

```python
def evaluate_expression(expr):
    if not expr:
        return 0

    stack = []
    num = 0
    op = '+'  # Default operator before the first number
    i = 0

    while i < len(expr):
        ch = expr[i]
        if ch.isdigit():
            num = num * 10 + int(ch)

        # If current character is an operator or the last character
        if ch in "+-*/" or i == len(expr) - 1:
            if op == '+':
                stack.append(num)
            elif op == '-':
                stack.append(-num)
            elif op == '*':
                stack.append(stack.pop() * num)
            elif op == '/':
                stack.append(stack.pop() / num)
            op = ch
            num = 0
        i += 1

    return sum(stack)

# Test Example
expr = "2*3+5/6*3+15"
result = evaluate_expression(expr)
print(result)  # Output: 23.5
```

By following this approach, arithmetic expressions without parentheses can be efficiently evaluated while maintaining proper operator precedence.
