# 16.3 Intersection

## Description

Given two straight line segments (represented as a start point and an end point), compute the point of intersection, **if any**.

**Example**
For the line segments:

```
Segment 1: (0, 0) to (4, 4)  
Segment 2: (0, 4) to (4, 0)
```

**Output**

```
The point of intersection is (2.0, 2.0)
```

## Explanation

The `find_intersection` function uses the **determinant method** from linear algebra to compute the intersection of two lines:

* First, it converts both line segments into the **general line form** `Ax + By = C`.
* Then, it calculates the **determinant** to check if the lines are **parallel**.
* If not parallel, it uses **Cramer's Rule** to solve for the intersection point `(x, y)`.

**Note:**
This function computes the intersection of the **infinite lines** passing through the segments. It does **not** check whether the intersection point lies **within both segments** (for that, bounding box checks would be needed).

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **ùëÇ(1)**: A constant number of arithmetic operations are performed.

#### Space Complexity

* **ùëÇ(1)**: No extra space beyond variables is used.

### Python Code

```python
def find_intersection(p1, p2, p3, p4):
    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2
    x3, y3 = p3
    x4, y4 = p4

    # Coefficients for line equations
    A1 = y2 - y1
    B1 = x1 - x2
    C1 = A1 * x1 + B1 * y1

    A2 = y4 - y3
    B2 = x3 - x4
    C2 = A2 * x3 + B2 * y3

    # Determinant of coefficient matrix
    det = A1 * B2 - A2 * B1
    if det == 0:
        return None  # Lines are parallel, no intersection

    # Compute intersection point using Cramer's Rule
    x = (B2 * C1 - B1 * C2) / det
    y = (A1 * C2 - A2 * C1) / det
    return x, y

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p1 = (0, 0)
    p2 = (4, 4)
    p3 = (0, 4)
    p4 = (4, 0)

    intersection = find_intersection(p1, p2, p3, p4)
    print(f"The point of intersection is {intersection}")
```

This solution efficiently computes the intersection point of two lines and can be adapted for more complex use cases, such as checking for intersection within the line **segments** themselves.
