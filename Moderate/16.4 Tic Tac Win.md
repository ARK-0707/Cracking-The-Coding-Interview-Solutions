# 16.4 Tic Tac Win

## Description

Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of **tic-tac-toe**.

The game board is a 3√ó3 grid, where each cell contains `'X'`, `'O'`, or is empty (`''` or `.`).
The winner is the player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

### Follow Up

Also handle cases for **tie** (no winner and board is full), and **ongoing games** (no winner yet and board is not full).

**Example**

For the board:

```
X O X  
O X O  
O X X
```

**Output**

```
The winner is: X
```

## Explanation

The `check_winner` function checks for the winner by:

1. Scanning all **rows** for three matching non-empty values.
2. Scanning all **columns** similarly.
3. Checking both **diagonals** for three matching values.
4. If no winner and all cells are filled, it returns `"Tie"`.
5. If no winner and the board still has empty cells, it returns `None`.

The `get_input_from_user` function allows the user to input the 3x3 board row by row in the terminal.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **ùëÇ(1)**: Since the board is always 3√ó3, checks are constant-time operations.

#### Space Complexity

* **ùëÇ(1)**: No additional data structures are used.

### Python Code

```python
def check_winner(board):
    n = len(board)

    # Check rows
    for row in board:
        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] and row[0] != '':
            return row[0]

    # Check columns
    for col in range(n):
        if board[0][col] == board[1][col] == board[2][col] and board[0][col] != '':
            return board[0][col]

    # Check diagonals
    if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] and board[0][0] != '':
        return board[0][0]
    if board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] and board[0][2] != '':
        return board[0][2]

    # Check for tie
    if all(cell != '' for row in board for cell in row):
        return "Tie"

    # Game not over
    return None

def get_input_from_user():
    print("Enter the tic-tac-toe board row by row")
    print("(Use 'X' for Player 1, 'O' for Player 2, and '' or '.' for empty cells.)")
    board = []
    for i in range(3):
        row = input(f"Row {i+1} (space-separated values, e.g. 'X O X'): ").strip().split()
        row = [cell if cell != '.' else '' for cell in row]
        if len(row) != 3:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter exactly 3 values per row")
            return None
        board.append(row)
    return board

if __name__ == "__main__":
    board = get_input_from_user()
    if board is None:
        print("Invalid board. Please restart.")
    else:
        result = check_winner(board)
        if result == 'Tie':
            print("The game is a tie.")
        elif result:
            print(f"The winner is: {result}")
        else:
            print("No winner yet.")
```

This approach provides a clean, reusable way to validate Tic-Tac-Toe results from user input or automated gameplay.
