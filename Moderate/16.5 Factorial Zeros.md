# 16.5 Factorial Zeros

## Description

Write an algorithm which computes the number of **trailing zeroes** in **n** factorial.

### Why It Works

Trailing zeroes are caused by multiples of **10** in `n!`.
Since `10 = 2 √ó 5`, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial,
we only need to count the number of **factors of 5** in `n!`.

**Example**

For `n = 100`, the factorial `100!` ends with:

```
24 trailing zeroes
```

## Explanation

The algorithm works as follows:

* Divide `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc. (powers of 5) and sum up the quotients.
* This gives the total number of times 5 is a factor in numbers from 1 to `n`.

This handles:

* `5` (contributes 1 zero)
* `25` (contributes 2 zeroes)
* `125` (contributes 3 zeroes)
* and so on‚Ä¶

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **ùëÇ(log‚ÇÖ(n))**: As `n` is divided by increasing powers of 5.

#### Space Complexity

* **ùëÇ(1)**: Uses only a constant amount of extra space.

### Python Code

```python
def trailingZeroes(n):
    if n < 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    while n >= 5:
        n //= 5
        count += n
    return count

n = 100
print(f"The trailing zeroes in {n}! is {trailingZeroes(n)}")
```

This is a highly efficient method to compute trailing zeroes in a factorial,
especially useful when `n` is very large.
