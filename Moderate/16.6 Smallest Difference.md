# 16.6 Smallest Difference

## Description

Given two arrays of integers, compute the **pair of values** (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

### Example

**Input**

```
A = [1, 3, 15, 11, 2]  
B = [23, 127, 235, 19, 8]
```

**Output**

```
The smallest difference in array is: 3 with pairs: (11, 8)
```

## Explanation

The `smallestDifference` function works as follows:

1. **Sort both arrays** to allow efficient comparison.
2. Use a **two-pointer approach** to iterate through both arrays:

   * If `A[a]` is smaller, move pointer `a` ahead.
   * If `B[b]` is smaller, move pointer `b` ahead.
   * Track the **smallest absolute difference** encountered.
3. This ensures that comparisons are always moving toward a minimal difference.

### Why Sorting Helps

Sorting enables linear traversal to compare closest values from each array without checking all possible pairs, making the algorithm efficient.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **ùëÇ(n log n + m log m)**: Due to sorting both arrays of sizes `n` and `m`.
* **ùëÇ(n + m)**: For the two-pointer traversal.

#### Space Complexity

* **ùëÇ(1)**: Only a constant number of variables are used.

### Python Code

```python
def smallestDifference(A, B):
    # Sort the arrays
    A.sort()
    B.sort()

    a = 0
    b = 0

    result = float('inf')
    pair = (float('inf'), float('inf'))

    # Two-pointer traversal
    while a < len(A) and b < len(B):
        if abs(A[a] - B[b]) < result:
            result = abs(A[a] - B[b])
            pair = (A[a], B[b])

        if A[a] < B[b]:
            a += 1
        else:
            b += 1

    return result, pair

A = [1, 3, 15, 11, 2]
B = [23, 127, 235, 19, 8]
result, pair = smallestDifference(A, B)
print(f"The smallest difference in array is: {result} with pairs: {pair}")
```

This approach avoids brute-force comparison and efficiently finds the closest pair between two arrays.
