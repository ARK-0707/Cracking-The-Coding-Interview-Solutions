# 16.7 Number Max

## Description

Write a method that finds the **maximum** of two numbers. You should `not use if-else or any other comparison operator.`

### Example

**Input**

```
a = 5, b = 10
```

**Output**

```
The max number between 5 & 10 is: 10
```

## Explanation

The method uses **bit manipulation** to find the maximum:

1. Compute `c = a - b`.
2. Right shift `c` by 31 bits to extract the **sign bit** (works for 32-bit integers).

   * If `a >= b`, `c` is non-negative → sign bit is `0`.
   * If `a < b`, `c` is negative → sign bit is `1`.
3. Multiply the sign bit `k` by `c` and subtract it from `a`:

   * If `k = 0`, result = `a - 0 = a`
   * If `k = 1`, result = `a - c = b`

This effectively returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.

### Caveat

This solution is specific to 32-bit signed integers. For 64-bit or different environments, the logic may require adjustment.

### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

* **𝑂(1)**: Performs a fixed number of arithmetic and bitwise operations.

#### Space Complexity

* **𝑂(1)**: Uses only a constant amount of space.

### Python Code

```python
def getMax(a, b):
    c = a - b
    k = (c >> 31) & 0x1  # Extract sign bit
    max_num = a - k * c  # If k == 0 → a, if k == 1 → b
    return max_num

a, b = 5, 10
print(f"The max number between {a} & {b} is: {getMax(a, b)}")
```

This clever use of bit operations allows comparisons without using traditional branching logic or operators, which can be especially useful in low-level programming or performance-critical systems.
